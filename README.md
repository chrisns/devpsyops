## TL;DR: Dev<em>What</em>Now?
[Psychological Operations (PSYOPS)](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/psyops) in a military context involve the use of psychological tactics to influence the attitudes, emotions, and behavior of a target audience in order to achieve military objectives. In this space, PSYOPS plays a
crucial role by leveraging psychological principles to shape perceptions, alter behaviors, and impact decision-making among both enemy and friendly populations.

Similarly, in the context of DevPsyOps, the incorporation of psychological insights into software development can also influence user behavior and decision-making. By understanding user motivations,
preferences, and cognitive biases, developers can tailor user interfaces, features, and communication strategies to guide users toward desired actions, just as psychological tactics guide military targets toward specific behaviors. This user-centered approach can result in increased engagement, higher adoption rates, and more successful software products, mirroring the objectives of PSYOPS in the military domain.

DevPsyOps, a combination of Development, Psychology, and Operations, can bring about a more holistic and effective approach to software development. By incorporating psychological insights into the
development process, teams can better understand user behavior, enhance user experience, and optimize software performance. This can lead to increased user satisfaction, better retention rates, and improved overall product success. Moreover, DevPsyOps can foster healthier team dynamics and communication, resulting in higher developer satisfaction and productivity. This interdisciplinary approach can ultimately lead to more thoughtful, user-centric, and successful software products.

## How does this fit into the other DevOps practices, and why do we need another?

DevPsyOps stands apart from other DevOps practices by emphasizing the integration of developers within the business context, particularly in situations involving internal political challenges.

We need it because software development is a creative process, not an industrial one.
Treating developers like unthinking cogs in a production pipeline to be told what to do creates a poor working environment for everyone and usually terrible outcomes. So they need to know how to work in the customer environment and the customer needs to know how to work with them.

Here's how DevPsyOps differs from other practices:

### DevPsyOps (Development, Psychology, Operations)

- **Psychological Alignment**<br /> DevPsyOps focuses on understanding the psychological dynamics of interfacing developers with the rest of the business. It recognizes developers' motivations and concerns, tailoring strategies to promote collaboration and deliver business value amidst internal political adversity.
- **Emotional Intelligence**<br /> DevPsyOps places importance on emotional intelligence and effective communication, aiming to navigate complex interpersonal relationships and conflicts.
- **Internal Politics**<br /> DevPsyOps specifically addresses internal political challenges that might hinder effective collaboration and value delivery. It aims to create an environment where developers can thrive despite such challenges.

### DevSecOps (Development, Security, Operations)
- **Security Integration**<br /> DevSecOps primarily revolves around seamlessly integrating security
measures into the development and operational processes to ensure the safety of applications and data.
- **Risk Management**<br /> DevSecOps focuses on identifying and mitigating security risks associated with software development and deployment.
- **Compliance and Regulations**<br /> DevSecOps ensures that applications adhere to relevant security regulations and compliance standards. 

### DevFinOps (Development, Finance, Operations)

- **Financial Optimization**<br />DevFinOps centers on optimizing costs and resource allocation within the software development lifecycle, ensuring efficient financial practices.
- **Budget Management**<br />DevFinOps involves tracking and managing expenses related to development, operations, and infrastructure.
- **Resource Efficiency**<br />DevFinOps focuses on minimizing wastage and maximizing resource utilization to align with budgetary constraints.


In summary, DevPsyOps uniquely addresses the challenges of internal politics and psychological dynamics when integrating developers into the business context. It complements DevSecOps' focus on security integration and DevFinOps' emphasis on financial efficiency, each contributing distinct perspectives to the overall DevOps philosophy.
